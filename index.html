          The dress <br>
          It’s a tricky thing, being a wedding guest. <br> <br> <br>
          Among the endless list of requirements – buy a present, arrange accommodation, practise your small <br> <br> <br> talk – there’s one obligation that trumps them all in terms of effort: fix up and look sharp. <br> <br> <br>
          
          The rules surrounding wedding guest dressing are as nuanced as they come. <br> <br> <br>
          
          There are some obvious musts – avoiding white is always a good idea – and others that are only <br> <br> <br> acknowledged by serial wedding-goers, such as steering clear of stilettos unless you enjoy the feeling <br> of numbness in your feet. <br> <br> <br>
          
          In the summer, things get even more complicated. Not only do you have to find a sweat-free way to <br> <br> <br> “dress to the nines”, but you have to strike the right balance between playful sunshine garb and formal <br> occasionwear. This forces you to ask difficult questions, such as “Is this wrap dress more ‘I do’ or <br> <br> <br> ‘BBQ?’” and “Does this hat make me look like a chic French woman, or a dishevelled bird?” <br> <br> <br>
          
          It’s no mean feat, so here’s our handy guide to summer wedding guest dressing, with tips from industry <br> <br> <br> experts on the trends and colours you need to know about this season .
